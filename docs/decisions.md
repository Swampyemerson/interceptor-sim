# Decisions log (ADR-lite)

Format: context / options / decision / why / date. Councils noted where convened.

---

## ADR-0001 — PX4-Autopilot lives outside the project repo
- **Context:** PX4 is a ~2 GB clone with its own git history and build tree.
- **Options:** (a) clone inside `interceptor-sim/` and gitignore it; (b) clone to `~/PX4-Autopilot`.
- **Decision:** (b) `~/PX4-Autopilot`.
- **Why:** keeps this portfolio repo small and clean; no risk of accidentally committing build artifacts; standard PX4 dev layout.
- **Date:** 2026-07-04. (No council — reversible.)

## ADR-0002 — Environment baseline: WSL2 + RTX 4070, headless by default
- **Context:** KICKOFF-PROMPT.md described a "fresh VM, no GPU"; CLAUDE.md (newer) and `nvidia-smi` confirm WSL2 with an RTX 4070.
- **Decision:** Trust the live environment: GPU available for camera rendering (M1+) and the demo; all automated/batch runs stay `HEADLESS=1` for speed and reproducibility.
- **Why:** headless runs are reproducible and faster; the GPU only matters where pixels matter.
- **Date:** 2026-07-04. (No council — observation, not a fork.)
